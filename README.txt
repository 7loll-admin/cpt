== üèÜ Integrate Custom Post Type in WooCommerce ==

To integrate a custom post type with WooCommerce and display the price and cart button using shortcodes, follow these steps:

Install and activate the "WC Integration" plugin in your WordPress site.

After activating the plugin, a new menu item called "WC Integration" will appear in the WordPress admin sidebar. Click on it to access the plugin settings.

In the plugin settings page, you will find the option to "Select Post type & Price Meta key." This is where you will configure the integration for your custom post type.

In the dropdown list, locate and select the desired custom post type that you want to integrate with WooCommerce. This custom post type should already be created in your WordPress site.

Once you have selected the custom post type, you will also need to select the meta key that is related to the price for the selected custom post type. This meta key is the field where the price information is stored for each post.

Save the settings after selecting the custom post type and the price meta key.

Now, you can use the provided shortcodes to display the price and cart button for the custom post type in your WooCommerce shop or any other appropriate location.

To display the price, use the shortcode [cptwooint_price/].
To display the cart button, use the shortcode [cptwooint_cart_button/].
Simply add these shortcodes to the relevant pages, posts, or templates where you want the price and cart button to appear for your custom post type.


By following these steps and using the provided shortcodes, you should be able to integrate a custom post type with WooCommerce and display the price and cart button for your custom posts.
